# React Authorisation Form
## Summary
My first React project assisted by Codecademy as part of the Learn React course. The task was to add password authorization to the contact page in order to hide the contact information from unauthorized access.
## Importance
- Many websites that already exists have password protected modules
- Adding this functionality ensures there is no unauthorised access or data leaks
- Using conditions to hide website modules will help to manage paid or account based content
## Demo
